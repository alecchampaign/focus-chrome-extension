# Focus Chrome Extension
Personal project based on the Codesmith CSX unit: https://csx.codesmith.io/units/chrome-extension
This chrome extension will block distracting content on certain sites which prove unproductive. All media content will be replaced with a motivational message, accompanied by an inspiring photo.

# Blacklisted sites
This chome extension is active on all sites which have associated scripts in the 'contexts' folder. As of now, only Reddit and YouTube are supported.

# Other files
popup.html: A very simple popup for when the extension is clicked

style.css: Provides styling for injected content

jquery.min.js: Jquery dependency

manifest.json: Manages chrome extension settings
